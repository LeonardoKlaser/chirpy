# Chirpy - A Go-Powered Social Network

## üöÄ About This Project

Chirpy is a social network application, similar to Twitter, built as a practical project for the [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) backend development course. The primary goal of this project is to apply and demonstrate the concepts learned throughout the course, focusing on building a production-style HTTP server in Go.

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience in building a complete backend system from scratch.

## ‚ú® Learning Objectives & Features Implemented

This project covers a wide range of backend development concepts, including:

*   **Web Server Fundamentals:** Understanding the core principles of web servers and their role in powering web applications.
*   **HTTP Server in Go:** Building a robust HTTP server using Go's standard library, without relying on external frameworks.
*   **RESTful API Design:** Implementing a clean and efficient RESTful API using:
    *   JSON for data interchange.
    *   HTTP headers for metadata.
    *   Appropriate HTTP status codes for client communication.
*   **Go for Web Development:** Exploring why Go is a suitable and performant language for building web servers.
*   **Database Interaction:**
    *   Using type-safe SQL for data persistence.
    *   Storing and retrieving data from a PostgreSQL database.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implementing a secure system for user authentication and authorization, leveraging well-tested cryptography libraries.
*   **Webhooks & API Keys:** Building and understanding the mechanics of webhooks and API key management.
*   **API Documentation:** Documenting the REST API using Markdown for clarity and ease of use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Language:** Go
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **API:** RESTful
*   **Authentication:** JWTs (likely, based on typical Go auth practices) and cryptographic libraries
*   **Documentation:** Markdown

## üìÑ API Documentation

The REST API for Chirpy is documented in Markdown. This documentation provides details on available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms. (You might want to add a link here if you host the documentation separately, e.g., `[View API Documentation](API_DOCS.md)`)
